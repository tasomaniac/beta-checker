This app has no UI.

It is a very very small utility application. 

Go to the Play Store and click on any of the apps you find. 

Scroll until you find the "Share" button. It is below the ratings and reviews. 

Press share and choose this app. 

You will be redirected to the beta testing enrollment web page. 

Many apps do not have a beta testing setup but it is ok to try them anyways.
